# CPM 2.2 B03

This folder contains clean disk images for CP/M 2.2, Build 03
For example, system60.dsk is a system disk for 60K of RAM.

Each system disk contains the following transient CP/M commands:  STAT, LOAD, PIP, SYSGEN, MOVCPM, SUBMIT, and DDT.  I do not include ASM and ED, since you may wish to use your own Assembler(s) and Editor(s). The disks include a system startup batch file, PROFILE.SUB, which extinguishes the programmed output LEDs.  This is a good indicator that CP/M has booted, even before you connect TTY or other console.

Files *.sys are CP/M image files, meant to be copied to the TPA for subsequent SYSGEN.
