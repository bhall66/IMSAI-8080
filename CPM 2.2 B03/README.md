# CPM 2.2 B03

This folder contains clean disk images for CP/M 2.2, Build 03
For example, system60.dsk is the disk image for a system disk for 60K of RAM.

Each system disk contains the following transient CP/M commands:  STAT, LOAD, PIP, SYSGEN, MOVCPM, SUBMIT, and DDT.  I do not include ASM and ED, since you may wish to use your own Assembler(s) and Editor(s).

Each disk also includes a batch file which runs at startup, PROFILE.SUB, which extinguishes the programmed output LEDs.  This is a good indicator that CP/M has booted, even before you connect TTY or other console.
