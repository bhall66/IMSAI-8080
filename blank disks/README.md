# Blank Disks

This folder contains blank floppy disk images for the IMSAI 8080 esp.

"blank.dsk" is filled with zeros.



"blankE5.dsk" is filled with the hex value E5, like the original floppies.

Both work equally well.



"noSys.dsk" is blank, except for a faux-bootloader than prints "Not a system disk"

if there is an attempt to boot from it.
