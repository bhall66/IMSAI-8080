block.bas is an XYBASIC program that takes a block number (CP/M allocate disk space, 1K in size) and shows the eight track/sectors and disk image byte offsets for this block.

sysAddr.bas is an XYBASIC program that displays the CCP, BDOS, BIOS, and BIOS function addresses for the current system.

block.hex and blockA.hex are CP/M "programs", exactly 1 block in length, that highlight how blocks are allocated in the CP/M file system.
